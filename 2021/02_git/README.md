## Assignment 

Create a folder using the following naming convention: `<first>_<last>`
cd into the folder and create a file called `README.md`. This is the file that github will show when you look at a folder. 
In the `README.md` file put your first and last name as a header like so: 
```
# <first> <last>
```
Below you may put anything that you want to share (does not necessarily have to be about you). Or you may put nothing. 
Finally commit and push your changes. 

## Extra 

The `README.md` file is in a special markdown format that is compatiable with HTML. 
You can read more about markdown [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet). 

If you feel like spicing up your markdown file then try adding an image or maybe some links...
