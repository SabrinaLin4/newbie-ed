The plan of the fist lesson is to cover the topics in this slide.

Instead of doing the slide, I am considering doing live coding to explain subjects
as it allows me to explain things using code instead of pointing to examples in the 
slide.

I think it might be more adaptable. The Lesson.java file in this folder is the
plan that I would plan to take the live code in. It comes with explainations 
and code that should be used in the lesson.

My plan is to cover:
    - Comments
    - Variables
    - Print Statements
    - Conditionals / If Statements
    - While Loops
        - For Loops?
    - Imports?
    - Objects
        - Opening a file?
    - Functions?
        - Calling them
        - Inputs
        - Outputs
